I will attempt to make some posts here, from time to time. No promises
on anything, including quality, intelligence, or lack of mistakes.

Actually, I think I can solidly promise the opposite.

PLEASE file issues if you have questions, comments, or criticisms.
In particular, if any section is unclear, I'd be happy to update it.
