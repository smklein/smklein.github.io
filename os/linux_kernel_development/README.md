# Linux Kernel Development

These are my notes from reading "Linux Kernel Development" (Third Edition) by
Robert Love.  All in all, a pretty good book. I recommend it to anyone with a
vague understanding of kernel development who wants to understand the
intricacies of the Linux kernel, specifically.
