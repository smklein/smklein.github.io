~~~ WHAT'S A DENTRY?

A 'dentry', or directory entry, is a "specific component in path".
Dentries are created on the fly by VFS, and they live in RAM. Since they exist
for performance reasons, they are not saved to disk.

~~~ CAN I SEE AN EXAMPLE?

Given a file, "/bin/vi", there are three dentry objects:
  "/"  : Root directory
  "bin": Another directory
  "vi" : A regular object

Dentries can be in one of three states, based on the "usage count":

used: The dentry corresponds with a valid inode -- the number of users of the
      inode is positive.
unused: The "d_count" is zero - the dentry is currently unused by VFS, but
        could potentially be used again. This dentry is prime for caching.
negative, or "invalid": The dentry is not associated with a valid inode, since
                        the inode was deleted or the pathname was never correct.

~~~ SO DENTRIES ARE CACHED?

Dentries are the result of the VFS layer resolving elements in a pathname. Once
computed, they can be re-used, if they are saved in a dentry cache, or "dcache".
