Here are a list of "good to know" commands for making / manipulating a
filesystem. As always, proceed with caution: some of these commands can be
dangerous if not used properly.

Unsure about your filesystem? Try playing around with commands to "list" what
storage you have accessible, and where it is mounted.

~~~ OBSERVING FILESYSTEMS ~~~

df: "how much of the DISK is FREE? (df) What filesystems am I using?"
  EX: View current usage of MOUNTED FILESYSTEMS.
    $ df -hT

~~~ ACCESSING HARDWARE / PARTITIONS ~~~

lshw: "list hardware"
  EX: "What disks do I currently have connected to my system?"
    $ sudo lshw -C disk

fdisk: "Manipulate disk partition tables".
  WARNING: THIS ONE IS DANGEROUS.
  Fdisk shows you EVERYTHING -- even devices that aren't mounted.
  EX: "Show me all partition tables". Your hard drive will probably be listed
    as one of "/dev/sda", "/dev/sdb", or "/dev/sdc".
    $ sudo fdisk -l
  EX: "Add a new partition to device /dev/sdc"
    $ sudo fdisk /dev/sdc
    $ Command (m for help): p     # View the partition table
    $ Command (m for help): d     # Delete a partition
    $ Command (m for help): n     # Make a new partition
    $ Command (m for help): t     # Change the type of a partition
    $ Command (m for help): w     # Write changes you've made to disk
    $ Command (m for help): q     # Quit without saving changes

parted: "Partition manipulation program"
  EX: Manipulate partitions (restore partitions, resize partitions, etc)
    $ sudo parted /dev/sdc

~~~ MAKING FILESYSTEMS ~~~

dd: "Make a new file".
  USAGE: Making new filesystem images / moving exisitng filesystem images.
  EX: Make a 10MB file (full of zeroes) by writing 10 chunks of 1MB each.
    $ dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/litefs bs=1M count=10
  EX: Backup the a disk into an image file. DANGEROUS.
    $ dd if=/dev/sdc1 of=/tmp/sdc1.img

mkfs: "Make a new filesystem"
  WARNING: "mkfs" by itself is deprecated. Typically, you'll use a fs-specific
    implementation, like "mkfs.ext4", or "mkfs.fat".
  EX:
    $ sudo mkfs.fat /dev/sdc2

~~~ PLACING FILESYSTEMS ~~~

mount: "Make a filesystem accessible to me"
  EX: Mount a device (USB? Hard drive? SSD?) on a dir named "storage"
    $ sudo mount /dev/sdc2 storage

umount: "Unmount. Get it out of my ACTIVE filesystem"
  EX: Removing the device we mounted, maybe so we can format the filesystem.
    $ sudo umount storage
