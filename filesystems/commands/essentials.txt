Here are a list of "good to know" commands for making / manipulating a
filesystem. As always, proceed with caution: some of these commands can be
dangerous if not used properly.


~~~ ACCESSING HARDWARE / PARTITIONS ~~~

lshw: "list hardware"
  EX: "What disks do I currently have connected to my system?"
    $ lshw -C disk

fdisk: "Manipulate disk partition tables".
  WARNING: THIS ONE IS DANGEROUS.
  EX: "Show me all partition tables". Your hard drive will probably be listed
    as one of "/dev/sda", "/dev/sdb", or "/dev/sdc".
    $ sudo fdisk -l
  EX: "Add a new partition to device /dev/sdc"
    $ sudo fdisk /dev/sdc
    $ Command (m for help): p     # View the partition table
    $ Command (m for help): d     # Delete a partition
    $ Command (m for help): n     # Make a new partition
    $ Command (m for help): w     # Write changes you've made to disk
    $ Command (m for help): q     # Quit without saving changes


~~~ MAKING FILESYSTEMS ~~~


df: "How much disk space am I using?"
  EX: View current usage:
    $ df -h

dd: "Make a new file".
  USAGE: Making new filesystem images / moving exisitng filesystem images.
  EX: Make a 10MB filesystem image (full of zeroes) by writing 10 chunks of 1MB
  each.
    $ dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/litefs bs=1M count=10

mkfs: "Make a new filesystem"
  WARNING: "mkfs" by itself is deprecated. Typically, you'll use a fs-specific
    implementation, like "mkfs.ext4", or "mkfs.fat".
  EX:


mount:
