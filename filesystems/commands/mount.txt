~~~ WHAT DOES THE MOUNT COMMAND DO?

It lets a user 'add' a filesystem to their current directory structure.

If you're on a Unix system, you already can access your files from a tree
starting at '/'. The 'mount' command can simply add additional filesystems to
this tree.

The general structure of 'mount' is something like this:

$ mount [DEVICE] [LOCATION]
For example,
$ mount /dev/hda2 /media/PHOTOS

Mount is also capable of reading your "/etc/fstab" file. Try looking at your
own fstab file now!

$ cat /etc/fstab

This file is a configuration file, listing all filesystems, and where they are
meant to be mounted. Think of this as a 'default settings' file for filesystem
mounting.
