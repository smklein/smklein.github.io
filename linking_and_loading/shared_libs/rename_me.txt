~~~ WHAT'S A SHARED LIBRARY?

When you execute a program, your OS and a "loader" take your compiled code and
place it in memory.

Typically, programs rely on a set of common functions, placed in "libraries".
If you've ever called "printf", then you've used a library. If you've ever used
"errno", then you've used a library.

This means that when you start a program which uses libraries, your OS will
carve out a space in memory for (a) your code, and (b) the libraries you depend
on.

People began to realize something -- there are tons of copies of these libraries
in memory! If I have 100 programs depending on "printf", then I have 100 copies
of "stdio" occupying RAM.

~~~ THAT SUCKS. CAN'T THESE LIBRARIES BE SHARED?

Yup. That's the whole reason shared libraries were originally created.
