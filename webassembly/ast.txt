~~~ WHAT DOES WASM CODE LOOK LIKE?

wasm is represented as an AST.

Every function body consists of one expression.

All expressions and operators are explicitly typed.
No implicit type conversions occur.

wasm memory is a contiguous, byte-addressable range of memory
from "0" to "memory_size". "Untyped array of bytes".

It's sandboxed. (how?)
It does not alias any part of the execution engine / execution stack /
local variables.
