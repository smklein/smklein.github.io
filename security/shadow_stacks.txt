I assume you know about stack-smashing attacks before reading this post.

~~~ STACK SMASHING ATTACKS SUCK. A LOT OF THEM SEEM TO RELY ON OVERWRITING
    THE RETURN ADDRESS ON THE STACK. HOW CAN WE DEFEND AGAINST THAT?

Use a shadow stack! The idea here is to place the return address in a
non-stack location, where it cannot be overwritten by a stack overflow.

There are several variations of shadow stacks. Some questions to consider:
- Does the shadow stack contain ONLY return addresses, or it is a fully
  parallel stack (as in, the shadow stack pointer is always equal to the
  real stack pointer + some offset)?

  These are referred to as the "traditional" vs "parallel" shadow stacks.

- Does the shadow stack verify the return address on the REAL stack by
  comparing the return addresses, or by just copying the return address
  from the shadow stack?

  These are referred to as the "overwriting" vs "checking" epilogues.
